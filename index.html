        <p > Hi, I'm Gašpar Dončević and it looks like you stumbled on my work in progress webpage. It's been a while since i've done something in html 
            so come back in a day or two to see the finished site. Sooo.... Get the hell out of my swamp.
        </p>
        <h2>A bit about me</h2>
        <p> I'll tell you a bit about what I do. 
            Personally, I really like researching uncommon solutions to problems regarding hardware limitations pushing the limits of hardware
            and like any good lemon, squeezing the hell out of it <br\>
            I'm an embedded systems engineer from Croatia and specialize in embedded systems. I create firmware for microcontrolers, 
            make pcb designs, and design electronic circuits. <br/> My <a href="https://github.com/GasparDoncevic/HDsEMG-for-ESP32S3"> masters thesis </a> 
            is a wireless system for measuring muscle activity from a large electorode grid. The while system was designed to adapt to different sizes of electrode grids
            thanks to it's modular design.
