        <p > Hi, I'm Gašpar Dončević and it looks like you've stumbled on my work in progress webpage. It's been a while since i've done something in html 
            so come back in a couple of days to see the finished site. 
        </p>
        <h2>A bit about me</h2>
        <p>
            I got my electrical enigneering masters degree in the summer of 2024. I specialized in electrical and computer engineering
            with sprinkled in classes in biomedical engineering. That means that I've seen almost most of it all, from sensor design, instrumentation,
            filter design, PCB design, embedded systems programing, Digital signal processing to a bit about anatomy and human locomotion.<br/>
        <h2>What do I even do?</h2>     
            Personally, I really like researching uncommon solutions to problems regarding hardware limitations pushing the limits of hardware
            and like any good lemon, squeezing the hell out of it <br\>
            I'm an embedded systems engineer from Croatia and specialize in embedded systems. I create firmware for microcontrolers, 
            make pcb designs, and design electronic circuits. <br/> My  masters thesis, titled <a href="https://github.com/GasparDoncevic/HDsEMG-for-ESP32S3"> <i>Designing a new generation system for High Density surface Electromyography</i></a>,
            is a wireless system for measuring muscle activity from a large electorode grid. The while system was designed to adapt to different sizes of electrode grids
            thanks to it's modular design.
