        <p> Hi, I'm Gašpar Dončević and it looks like you stumbled on my work in progress webpage. It's been a while since i've done something in html 
            so come back in a day or two to see the finished site. Sooo.... Get the hell out of my swamp.

        <h2>A bit about me</h2>
        <p> I'll tell you a bit about what I do. 
            Personally i really like researching uncommon solutions to problems regarding hardware limitations pushing the limits of hardware
            and like any good lemon, squeezing the hell out of it.
